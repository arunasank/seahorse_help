NOTES


1)Possible to export multiple keys, but you can't import multiple keys? *bug*

2)How can I sign keys using the UI? *figured*

3)Why do I have a *lot* of certificates under Root CA Certificates even though
I don't use encryption at all? *Read up RootCA certificates*

4)Error Message: General Error, cannot generate PGP Key generated. the problem
was with me having set an expiration date of less than one. This error message
should be changed to something more readable. *bug*

5)Bug, when you try to add more than one key, seahorse hangs. Is
it just me?(I tried this 5 times and it was the same every time).

6)Why are 2 subkeys created for each master key? *one subkey is the master
key*

7)What's Root2 Key Storage for? *It might be for storing X.509 certificates
for SSL and other things... I think there's a PKCS#11 module that programs like
Firefox can use(grawity on gnome-hackers)*

8)Subkeys not seen when key is Sign only(DSA Sign only in my case). Verify
for the other sign only key(RSA sign only)

9)How to add photos to Sign only keys(DSA Sign only in my case)? Verify
for the other sign only key(RSA sign only).
